# My Little Site

Here you will find the little site I made for myself.
It's super basic, but gets the job done.

You can check it out [here](https://www.blainecantrell.com).
You can also fork this repo and run the go server on my own machine. Completely up to you.

## You said I can run this locally?

Yupe. Find where you the downloaded the forked repo and jump into that directory.

```bash
cd $PATH
```
Then just open the ```index.html``` file with your favorite web browser.
