# My Little Site

Here you will find the little site I made for myself.
It's super basic, but gets the job done.

You can check it out ![here](https://www.blainecantrell.com).
You can also fork this repo and run the go server on my own machine. Completely up to you.

## FAQ: What is Go? How do I use it?

Download it ![here](https://golang.org/). Learn about it ![here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-go-from-zero-to-hero-d2a3223b3d86/). Practice how to use it ![here](https://gophercises.com/).

## You said I can run this locally?

Yupe. Find where you the downloaded the forked repo and jump into that directory.

```bash
cd $PATH
```

In the directory, you find a main go file. Run it and follow the address provided in the console. Have fun!

```go
go run main.go
```

## I Found an error.

Great! Open an new issue ![here](https://github.com/Whatchamazog/Site/issues).
