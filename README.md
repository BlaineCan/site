# My Little Site

Here you will find the little site I made for myself.
It's super basic, but gets the job done.

You can check it out ![here](https://www.blainecantrell.com).
You can also fork this repo and run the go server on my own machine. Completely up to you.

## You said I can run this locally?

Yupe. Find where you the downloaded the forked repo and jump into that directory.

```bash
cd $PATH
```

In the directory, install your dependencies and have fun!

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

## I Found an error.

Great! Open an new issue ![here](https://github.com/Whatchamazog/Site/issues).
